- **Status:** Current on all payments; no outstanding liens or foreclosure issues[21][22]

---

## Estate Management Structure

- All tax correspondence is directed to "C/O Pamela Williams," indicating a formal property management arrangement[19][20].
- Pamela Williams likely holds power of attorney, is the estate administrator, or provides professional property management for the Blevins family[19].
- This arrangement has been consistent since at least 2022, demonstrating ongoing estate management responsibility[20][22].

---

## Geographic and Timeline Analysis

**Location Significance:**
The Williams couple resides at Arbor Village Apartments, about 5 miles from the Fulton Street property. This proximity enables direct oversight and management of the vacant lot[19]. The Florence area provides the broader community context for this property management relationship.

**Key Timeline Events:**

- **July 2019:** Williams couple establishes residency at current address
- **December 2020:** Glenda Blevins passes away
- **2022:** Property tax management continues under Pamela Williams[20][22]
- **2024:** Property assessment remains stable at $2,400, with no significant development[20][22]

---

## Legal and Investigative Implications

- The property documents provide irrefutable evidence of the relationship between the Williams and Blevins families regarding real estate management[19][20][21].
- The formal property contact designation suggests a structured estate management arrangement, not casual assistance[19].
- Ongoing listing of Pamela Williams as contact person indicates continuing estate management duties beyond Glenda Blevins' death[19][20][22].
- This may involve formal legal documentation such as power of attorney or estate administration appointment.

---

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

- **Probate Court Research:**Examine Lauderdale County Probate Court records for estate proceedings involving Herman or Glenda Blevins. This would clarify Pamela Williams' legal authority and the formal nature of the property management arrangement.
- **Family Relationship Verification:**Additional research into potential family connections between the Williams and Blevins families could explain the trust relationship evident in the property management arrangement.
- **Professional Service Investigation:**
  Verify if Pamela Williams operates a formal property management business to clarify if the arrangement is commercial or personal.

---

## Conclusion

The property documents conclusively establish that Pamela Williams is the designated contact and presumed manager for Herman and Glenda Blevins' Fulton Street property in Florence, Alabama[19][20][21]. This investigation confirms the specific property connection linking all parties, resolving the initial question about relationships between the Williams and Blevins families[19][20]. The arrangement appears to be a formal estate management service that began after Glenda Blevins' death in December 2020 and continues to the present[22]. The evidence demonstrates a clear property-based relationship that explains the associate connections previously identified in public records[19].
