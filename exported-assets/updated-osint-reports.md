### Property Analysis

#### Fulton Street Property Details

- **Assessment History**: Property value has remained relatively stable, indicating minimal development or improvements
- **Tax Status**: Current with taxes ($24 annually), indicating active management
- **Location**: Florence, AL - approximately 5 miles from the Williams' current residence in Muscle Shoals

#### Estate Management Implications
- **Why Pamela Williams**: The designation of Pamela Williams as contact person suggests either:
  1. Formal appointment as estate administrator or executor
  2. Power of attorney arrangement established before Glenda's death
  3. Family relationship or trusted friend arrangement
  4. Professional property management service

### Timeline Analysis

- **2018**: Property complex at 600 Firestone Ave purchased for $13.9M (corporate ownership)
- **July 2019**: Pamela and Phillip Williams move to 600 Firestone Ave
- **December 24, 2020**: Glenda Blevins dies
- **2022-Present**: Pamela Williams continues as designated contact for Blevins property

### Investigative Significance

1. **Direct Connection Confirmed**: The property records establish an irrefutable link between the subjects
2. **Estate Management Role**: Pamela Williams' designation as contact person indicates a formal relationship beyond casual acquaintance
3. **Ongoing Responsibility**: The arrangement continues active management of the property post-death
4. **Geographic Proximity**: The Williams' residence is strategically located for property oversight

### Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Probate Court Records**: Search Lauderdale County Probate Court for any estate proceedings for Glenda or Herman Blevins
2. **Power of Attorney Documentation**: Investigate whether formal legal arrangements exist
3. **Family Tree Analysis**: Determine if blood relationship exists between Williams and Blevins families
4. **Professional Service Inquiry**: Verify if Pamela Williams operates a property management business

### Legal Considerations

- Property ownership remains with Herman Blevins (if alive) or his estate
- Pamela Williams' authority to act on behalf of the property should be verified through legal documentation
- Any property transactions would require proper estate authorization
